We just posted a blueprint to the OFLB Launchpad detailing our
plans for rehashing the Guidebook:

> The current layout of the wiki is somewhat confusing when you don't
> really know what you're looking for. It would be desirable for it to
> be a solid piece of documentation covering the many sides of libre
> font design, as well as OFLB specifics.
>
> The wiki approach works well, but is missing general structure. We
> thought it would be useful to combine a 'booklike' layout with a
> reference section where most of the existing lists can be dumped and
> referred to. The Django documentation is a good reference, featuring a
> 'book' and a reference section. Both of the parts are independent but
> work together, referencing each other multiple times.
>
> Following this general approach, our initial idea would be to separate
> the content into  
>  - chapters, with general and/or step-by-step explanations of
> different subjects  
>  - and appendixes/lists, as reference or complementing the subjects
> explored in the chapters above.
>
> The idea would be to use all the existing content, editing some
> sections as well as aggregating interspersed parts into general
> sections (e.g. Glossary, FAQ). Here's a tentative layout for this.

> CHAPTERS

>  Tools and Software  
>  Getting started with OFLB  
>  Type on the Web  
>  FAQ

> APPENDIXES / LISTS / REFERENCE  
>  - Glossary  
>  - Font formats  
>  - Licenses  
>  - Web typography toolkits (HTML, CSS, JS)  
>  - Existing libre fonts (not in OFLB)  
>  - Specimens and scans  
>  - Libre fonts people (blogs, websites)  
>  - External resources (Software, Knowledge, Education)
