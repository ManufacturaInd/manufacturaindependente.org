We integrated the advisor team for Interactivos'13.
Interactivos' is an initiative of the Medialab-Prado, in Madrid. Two intense weeks to excahnge ideas, discuss, learn and develop projects.
The 2013 edition was themed *Tools for a read-write world* and was dedicated to envisioning the future of Libre and Open source software for graphics and design. The title is a reference to the Free/Libre software principles -- run, study, redistribute and improve --,  under the digital files permission jargon. In a nutshell, a digital file can allow users to *read* and/or *write* and/or *execute*, hence a read-write world is a clear instigation to collaborative design practises, where the tools and the objects are open for study and modification.

Together with Femke Snelting, ginger coons, Jennifer Dopazo, Vicente Ruiz Jurado and Samer Hassan
