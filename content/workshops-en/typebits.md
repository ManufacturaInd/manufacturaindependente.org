Type:Bits is a collaborative type design workshop following on the steps 
of [fonts.txt](http://manufacturaindependente.org/fontstxt). 
The methodologies and the library we use to generate the fonts 
are overall the same: paper sketches are the starting point to design 
the letters, ASCII art to digitise the letters and our pipeline using the 
[Graphicore bitmap font](http://graphicore.de/en/archive/2010-09-09_A-Brute-Font-Attack) 
library to convert the text files into OpenType fonts.

As we continue to explore the possibilities of designing bitmap inspired fonts 
we take the chance to expand on our tool chain. This time, instead of having 
the participants work on a text editor and manually gather the files in 
an USB stick or shared folder, we worked with Git. With a brief introduction 
to Git and version control, we had everyone using Gitlab's online editing 
interface and committing their work to a public repository.

[Type:Bits](https://gitlab.com/typebits) is now a group at Gitlab where we are 
gathering the repositories of  the fonts we are producing in the workshops: 
fonts.txt at BAU, in Barcelona; Type:Bits at 
[Escuela de Arte António Lopéz](http://escueladeartetomelloso.org), in 
Tomelloso; and Type:Bits at [ESAPA](http://www.esapa.org), in Avilés. 
Besides the fonts we have a repository with the 
[bitmap font builder](https://gitlab.com/typebits/bitmapfontbuilder), 
containing the scripts we use to generate the fonts from the `.txt` files and 
another repository with the [template structure](https://gitlab.com/typebits/cookiecutter-bitmapfont) 
we defined for the font repositories. It is exciting to do these workshops and 
with each one take the time to review, organise and publish the small scripts 
and tools we do. Using Gitlab repositories allowed us to share the work done 
in the workshops in a clearer way: the history of commits documents the rhythm 
of the work, the contributions of each person and provides all the source 
files, from the `.txt` to the `.otf` files.

Finally, we taking advantage of Gitlab pages to build an HTML specimen for the 
fonts. This is great for reviewing letter design as during the workshop (or 
after!) and quickly showcase the font.

This year, in Avilés, we did two workshops and ended up with four fonts: 
[Muralla](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-muralla), 
[Roseta](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-roseta), 
[Ladrillo](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-ladrillo) and 
[Persiana](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-persiana). 
Last year, in Tomelloso, three fonts came out of the workshop: 
[Avestruz](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-avestruz), 
[Flamingo](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-flamingo) and 
[Tucan](https://gitlab.com/typebits/font-tucan). All of these fonts are 
under the Open Font License, and have properly documented FONTLOGs. They're 
ours and yours to use, improve, share and redistribute!
