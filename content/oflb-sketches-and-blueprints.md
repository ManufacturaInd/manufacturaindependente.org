We got our hands full with the first phase of the work for releasing
Open Font Library 0.3. We kept sketching and making notes during an
online VOIP meeting with Dave and [Fabricatorz](http://fabricatorz.com/)
Jon Phillips and Christopher Adams (above, our frantic loose notes as we
tried to pin down all points and new ideas).

The redesign process usually ends up involving smaller, but not less
important, design details. We found that most discussions relating to
technical details ended up being closely related to design issues. For
instance, at one point we were discussing internal details about the
implementation of OFLB translation, so that the website can be easily
translatable into other languages. It follows that, for the feature to
work properly, it needs a clear and usable interface -- that's where
design comes in. Good design can highlight and improve a good technical
feature; at the same time, having an awkward interface can jeopardise
all the effort in putting a technical implementation together.

Fabricatorz pointed out how useful having mockups can be for a
developer, as having even a blurry idea for an interface can make the
development process smoother, by making one realise details that weren't
clear, and even showing new possible directions for new features. As
we're typing out blueprints and publishing then on the [OFLB
launchpad](https://launchpad.net/openfontlibrary), we also did a very
rough first draft of the icons for marking the various flags a font can
have. (Well, the very first draft is in our notes above. So technically
this is a very rough second draft.) We're still trying out ideas and
shapes, and once we're happy with a visual style we will adapt them to a
design that can work in very small sizes.
