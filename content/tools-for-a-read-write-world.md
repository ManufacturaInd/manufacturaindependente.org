We have been busy at [Medialab
Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/) in Madrid for the last couple of
weeks, first participating in [Libre Graphics
Meeting](http://libregraphicsmeeting.org/2013/) (with two talks and a
workshop), and now we're integrating the
[Interactivos?'13](http://medialab-prado.es/article/future_tools)
advisors team, along with [ginger coons](http://adaptstudio.ca),
[Jennifer Dopazo](http://www.jenniferdopazo.com/graphic/), [Samer
Hassan](http://samer.hassan.name) and [Vicente Ruiz
Jurado](http://medialab-prado.es/person/vicente_jurado).

This edition of Interactivos? is dedicated to the theme of [Tools for a
Read-Write World](http://medialab-prado.es/article/future_tools), and 9
projects have been selected for an intensive development sprint at the
beautiful new Medialab Prado HQ.

For the first time in Interactivos?, there is going to be a printed
collection of the projects' diverse outcomes. We took the task of laying
out and designing the cover of this publication, while ginger coons,
Femke Snelting and Jennifer Dopazo take care of gathering material and
editing it.

Following the sprinting methodology of the workshop, we have spent a
full day brainstorming, looking for possible design cues and defining a
visual language for this publication, given the extremely tight
timeframe (3 and a half days from beginning until it's all printed!)

Working with
[plotters](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/03/scheming-and-plotting/)
has given us new cues about how to use b√©zier strokes as expressive
design elements; drawing from technical diagrams and axonometric
projections, we've been going through a hectic iterative process, trying
out different layouts and positionings around the [I-beam
character](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/ibeam.htm).
