We built a set of small scripts to automate certain tasks in our type design workflow. One of them, Transpacing, gets the spacing table from a libre font and imports it into another libre font. We wrote it to do one of the iterations of PropCourier Sans and it has proven useful in several situations where we wanted to re-use existing spacing settings instead of starting from scratch.

In this workshop, we introduced students to the command line and taught them how to use Transpacing to manipulate and generate font files.

This workshop was hosted at the [Ã‰cole de Recherche Graphique](http://www.erg.be), in Brussels, in February 2014, as part of [Femke Snelting's](http://snelting.domainepublic.net/) Toolbending class.
