Last week we were busy with the Catalogue. We changed from a
two column page layout to a single column one.  
On one hand this shift allowed for a cleaner and clearer view of the
fonts displayed. On the other hand, it left us with the hard task of
integrating the filters in the main column.

To simplify the UI we settled for an horizontal bar containing all the
filters. This bar was placed below the text preview options. It is
composed by three dropdown menus: one for font category, other for
license and other for list ordering.

Taking cues from the Google Webfont directory we made multiple selection
dropdowns for font category and license. This way it is possible to mix
and match a richer combination of choices when browsing the font
Catalogue.
