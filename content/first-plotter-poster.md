Last year, after [reviving an old Roland
plotter](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/03/scheming-and-plotting),
we took the chance to make some prints with it. The most refined and
finished one was poster with the cover illustration of the [Libre
Graphics magazine](http://libregraphicsmag.com) issue 1.2.

The full poster took more than four hours to print. We used an A2 size
fluorescent green cardboard and white and black markers. Here is a short
video of the printing in action:
