Viagens Com Alma was a long-duration project by Visões Úteis, spanning several
months and many artists reflecting on religious imagery and subjective
geography.

We designed the graphic identity of Viagens Com Alma, as well as creating some
of the printed materials for public moments, along the two years it took place.

We’ve been frequent collaborators of [Visões Úteis](http://visoesuteis.pt
"Visões Úteis"), a theatre company based in Porto which has been active for
more than 20 years. [Viagens Com Alma](http://viagenscomalma.eu/ "Viagens com
Alma") was a long-duration project spanning several months and many artists
reflecting on religious imagery and subjective geography.

From the project's introduction:

    The four mini audio-walks that constitute the Viagens com Alma project
    opened to the public on May 23rd 2011 in Cête, Vairão, Paço de Sousa and Santo
    Tirso. Four routes which cross fiction with architecture and the spirit of four
    monasteries in the Porto District, which mirror different relationships between
    the immaterial -- human devotion -- and the material -- the places, objects and
    rituals which make that devotion tangible.

    Inspired on the A Língua das Pedras project, which we developed in 2010 for
    marking the 1100 years of the Order of Cluny, these audio-walks were
    accompanied by installations and artistic pieces which underscored the
    connection between this local heritage and the European network of Cluny
    monuments and landmarks.

## Identity and print

We took care of the general graphic identity of Viagens Com Alma, as well as
creating some of the printed materials for Visões Úteis’ various steps through
this project as well as its predecessor, [A Língua das
Pedras](http://visoesuteis.pt/en/component/k2/item/183-cluny-a-l%C3%ADngua-das-pedras).

## DVD Sleeve

A year later, we went back to the project to design the sleeve for the DVD edition that was published as the final act of Viagens Com Alma, featuring video art pieces by [Pedro Maia](http://pedromaia.net) and [Michele Putortì](http://micheleputorti.com).
