Description: Parliamentary open data portal

Demo.cratica is a public portal to easily access the workings of the Portuguese
parliament, with info on MP's and plenary sessions, which we initiated because
of the frustration caused by the official portal's complex interface.

--

From our work as part of the [TransparÃªncia Hackday Portugal]
(http://transparenciahackday.org) collective, we created the 
parliamentary monitoring website
[Demo.cratica](http://demo.cratica.org).
It is a carefully designed interface to the information
released by the Portuguese Parliament on MP's and session transcripts.  
The official Parliament website hides most useful information behind
many layers of obscure interfaces and terminology. With this project, we
wanted to make a point on how information being available does not mean
that it is accessible; and as part of that point, we tried our hand at
building something better.
