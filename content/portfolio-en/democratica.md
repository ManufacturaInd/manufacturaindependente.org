From our work as part of the TransparÃªncia Hackday Portugal
collective, we created the parliamentary monitoring website
Demo.cratica. It is a carefully designed interface to the information
released by the Portuguese Parliament on MP's and session transcripts.  
The official Parliament website hides most useful information behind
many layers of obscure interfaces and terminology. With this project, we
wanted to make a point on how information being available does not mean
that it is accessible; and as part of that point, we tried our hand at
building something better.
