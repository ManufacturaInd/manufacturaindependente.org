Eggs & Ham in Rotterdam is a collection of 22 short stories first written and
illustrated in 2006, when we were living in the Netherlands.

We re-illustrated the stories and documented the production process for the
edition by Porto based publisher [Plana](http://planapress.org/en/books/eggs-ham-in-rotterdam).
