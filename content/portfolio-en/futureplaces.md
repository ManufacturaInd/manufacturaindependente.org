Description: Print and online identity design

The <a target="_blank" href="http://futureplaces.org">FuturePlaces</a> medialab, based in Porto, organizes a annual event to serve as a catalyst of the work developed in their citizen labs and a space to interact with the city.

Since 2013 we have been responsible for the design of their website and for the post-production of the printed materials for each annual event.

Heitor Alvelos, FuturePlaces curator and agent provocateur, takes the lead as Art Director, conceptualising the theme and imagery behind each edition. In this scenario our work consists of adapting the images and concepts to the required print supports — mupi, poster, foldable schedule and stickers — and website.
