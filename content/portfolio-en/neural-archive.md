![The Neural Archive](http://media.manufacturaindependente.org/archive-neural.jpg)

[The Neural Archive](http://archive.neural.it) is a platform to catalogue 
and index Neural.it's vast collection of publications.
We created a custom site using the Web2Py framework, following the new 
[Neural.it](http://manufacturaindependente.org/neural-it.html) design. 
This new platform allows the Neural editors to easily add and edit 
the catalogue contents, with custom categories to help order 
the publications according to the editors' specifications.
