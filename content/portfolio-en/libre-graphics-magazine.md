The Libre Graphics magazine was a print publication dedicated to the
cross-overs between the fields of art & design and the world of libre and open
culture. The editorial team was led by ginger coons, with us taking care of
designing and co-editing the publication.

We had yearned for a publication that could combine the
critical perspective of an art and design magazine with a clear
free-culture angle. Together with [ginger coons](http://adaptstudio.ca),
we set out to make just that.

Active since 2010, the Libre Graphics magazine project has already
released 7 issues, covering subjects like collaboration,
internationalization and gender through a set of columns, showcases and
reports.
