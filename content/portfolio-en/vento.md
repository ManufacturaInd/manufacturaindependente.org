[O Vento](http://www.visoesuteis.pt/en/component/k2/item/184-o-vento "O Vento")
is a [Visões Úteis](http://visoesuteis.pt) project involving the beautiful
Afurada riverside and its community. From the original description:

    O Vento is an original performative experience in which the audience is
    invited to take part in the show. The creative process of O Vento started
    with a trip to the windmills of D. Quixote, in Spain, followed by a
    residence in a small fishing village in Portugal. It's purpose was to find
    an intersection between a universal, classical collective imaginary and a
    popular, local one. The final performance deals with a fragile community
    standing before the power of the wind, in a poetic attempt to find a
    balance between culture and nature.

We started working on the image for this play while it was being developed.
Inspired by photos of clothes hanging out to dry in the wind, we photographed a
series of checkered table cloths, being waved in the air. These images served
as a base grid upon the which we set to draw letters and illustrations for the
poster.

Under the windy letter there is an old map. It serves a reference to the
travelings of D. Quixote and other brave explorers, set out to find the
unknown.
