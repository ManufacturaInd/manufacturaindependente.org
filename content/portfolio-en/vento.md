O Vento, is an original performative experience in which the audience is invited to take part in the show. The creative process of O Vento started with a trip to the windmills of D. Quixote, in Spain, followed by a residence in a small fishing village in Portugal. It's purpose was to find an intersection between a universal, classical collective imaginary and a popular, local one. The final performance deals with a fragile community standing before the power of the wind, in a poetic attempt to find a balance between culture and nature.

We started working on the image for this play while it was being developed. Inspired by photos of clothe hanging out to dry we photographed a series checkered of table cloths,being wavered in the air.
These images served as a base grid upon the which we set to draw letters and illustrations for the poster.

Under the windy letter there is an old map. It serves a reference to the travelings of D. Quixote and other brave explorers, set out to find the unknown
