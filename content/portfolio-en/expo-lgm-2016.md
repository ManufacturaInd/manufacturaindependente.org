Libre Graphics Culture and Practice was an exhibition organised as part of LGM
2016. It took place in the London Gallery West, from 15 April to 22 May, and
featured the work of several artists and collectives whose work is grounded in
the Free Software and Free Culture mindsets, ranging from design to photography
or illustration.

We produced two compositions with our personal work: one devoted to the prints
we been creating using our pen plotter and one showcasing the fonts from our
foundry Oxshark Fontworks. We also produced the two compositions for the Libre
Graphics magazine.
