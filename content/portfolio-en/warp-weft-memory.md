The Warp and Weft of Memory is a poetic archive documenting and expanding on
the life and work of Dutch artist Gisèle d'Ailly van Waterschoot van der
Gracht.

From the growing collection of images, texts, objects, stories and spaces
surrounding Gisèle, we weaved an interface to read, browse and discover the
details and categorisations within. The immensity of information and its
variety of formats made us dive deep on ways to guide the user while, at the
same time, allowing the space for wander and discovery.

The final hybrid interface draws from online catalogues as well as text
adventure games, in weaving chapters together along with related information
gathered from the Semantic MediaWiki backend.
