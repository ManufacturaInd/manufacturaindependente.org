The warp and weft of memory is a poetic archive documenting and expanding on
the life and work of dutch artist Gisèle d'Ailly van Waterschoot van der
Gracht.

From the on-growing collection of images, texts, objects, stories and spaces
surrounding Gisèle we started weaving an interface to read, browse and
discover. The immensity of information and its variety of formats made us
question on ways to guide the user while, at the same time, allowing the space
for wander and discovery.

This project is ongoing and version one should be finished in the end of 2017.

words we could mention: hybrid archive, text-adventure
