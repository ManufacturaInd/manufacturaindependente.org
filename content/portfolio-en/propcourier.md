PropCourier is the canonical typeface for Libre Graphics magazine.
It was created through a conversion of OSP's [NotCourier Sans](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/notcouriersans) from a monospaced font into a proportional one.

From there, we've been refining the design and releasing new versions with each issue of Libre Graphics magazine, until we settled on a final design when we released issue 2.2 of the magazine.

You can download PropCourier Sans at [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/libregraphicsmag/propcouriersans/source/5bfd90cdbfd5ae1487110d43c4ff208cc7f17d67:) or [libregraphicsmag.com](http://libregraphicsmag.com/asset).
