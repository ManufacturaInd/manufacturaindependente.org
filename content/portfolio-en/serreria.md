"From Stone to Spaceship" was a type design workshop commissioned by Medialab
Prado to collaboratively create an open typeface based on the medialab
building's 1920 lettering.

Serreria Sobria and Serreria Extravagante were the two fonts designed by the
participants, the result of intense collaboration and free software.
