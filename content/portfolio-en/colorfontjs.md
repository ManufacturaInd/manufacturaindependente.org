Description: jQuery library for multi-colored type


We were commissioned by [Dave
Crossland](http://understandingfonts.com/who/dave-crossland/) to work on an
idea by [Eben Sorkin](http://sorkintype.com/) to enable the use of Art
Deco-style colored typefaces. 

Our efforts ended up in the form of a JavaScript library,
[Colorfont.js](http://manufacturaindependente.com/colorfont), which allows
anyone to use layered typefaces in web documents. Additionally, we've put
together a bundle of libre font remixes to be used with this library, such
as this edit we made of [Reglo](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/reglo) by
[Sebastien Sanfilippo](http://love-letters.be):

We hosted a set of workshops for collective colorfont design in Brussels,
Vienna and Coimbra.

Colorfont.js has seen some use around the web:

* It was beautifully used for rainbow effects in the site for a protest against
  Russia's anti-gay policies in 2013
* [OSP](http://osp.kitchen) have used it for the [Write Me a
  Shadow](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/workshop/write-me-a-shadow/)
  workshop
* It was employed, along with a custom-designed typeface, for the online
  identity of [Mons 2015 European Capital of
  Culture](http://www.festivaldeliege.be/mons2015_clip_image002.png).

Colorfont was also mentioned at the [W3C SVG OpenType
blog](https://www.w3.org/community/svgopentype/2012/04/29/workaround-colorfont-js/)
and the [BTK Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung's Online Publishing
course](http://blogs.btk-fh.de/onlinepub/).
