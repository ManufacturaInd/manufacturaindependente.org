Description: jQuery library for multi-colored type


We were commissioned by Dave Crossland to work on Eben Sorkinâ€™s idea of Art
Deco-style colored typefaces. Our efforts ended up in the form of a JavaScript
library, [Colorfont.js](http://manufacturaindependente.com/colorfont), which
enables the use of layered typefaces in web documents.

We put together a bundle of fonts to be used with Colorfont.js.

It was beautifully used for rainbow effects in the site for a protest against
Russia's anti-gay initiatives in 2013.

## Colorfont used in Mons 2015 identity

Mons was European Culture Capital for the year of 2015. The identity for this
initiative was conceived by Brussels design house My Agency, who commissioned
us to provide technical help and support for multicoloured typefaces, employing
our Colorfont library for the event's website.
