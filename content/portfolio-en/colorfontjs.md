Description: jQuery library for multi-colored type


We were commissioned by Dave Crossland to work on Eben Sorkinâ€™s idea of Art Deco-style colored typefaces. Our efforts ended up in the form of a JavaScript library, [Colorfont.js](http://manufacturaindependente.com/colorfont), which enables the use of layered typefaces in web documents.

We put together a bundle of fonts to be used with Colorfont.js.

It was beautifully used for rainbow effects in the site for a protest against Russia's anti-gay initiatives in 2013.
