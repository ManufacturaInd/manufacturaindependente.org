[Monsters of Law](https://monstersoflaw.brussels) is an initiative by the Free Knowledge Advocacy Group, a group of WikiMedians dedicated to critical perspectives on current law and copyright doctrine.

The event series required a clear and engaging identity which could symbolise and synthesise the focus on a critical discourse around law, as well as ways to make it approachable by a non-specialised audience. We based our visual take on the [silcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silcrow) character, fundamentally related to law documents. Our rendering of the character gives an explicit nod to digital culture while remaining human, by making the silcrow emerge from a diverse mosaic of shapes and texture.

Along with the graphic identity, we took care of the design and implementation of the [website](https://monstersoflaw.brussels) for the event series.
