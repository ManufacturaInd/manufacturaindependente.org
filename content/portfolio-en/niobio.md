[Nióbio](http://www.visoesuteis.pt/en/works/item/610-ni%C3%B3bio) is an
original theater play written by [Visões Úteis](http://visoesuteis.pt "Visões
Úteis") for the celebrations of Guimarães, 2012th European Capital of Culture.

From the original blurb:

    In a kind of territorial enclave, a peculiar group of characters agree to
    separate from their motherland and proclaim the independence of a new
    State. The new micro-nation, Nióbio, is composed of three inhabitants, a
    music band and a lobster. And the band is not even complete.

    Any nation which wants to become a serious nation requires its own History,
    laws and languages; if none of those exist, they can quickly be thought up.
    The new people of Nióbio shall implement all necessary procedures to
    validate the newborn country, going through the selection of national
    symbols, managing diplomatic relations with international organisations, as
    well as long-term sustainability strategies. However, despite all efforts
    from its founders (and only citizens), the nation of Nióbio does not face a
    promising future. Maybe because it can't help repeating the mistakes which
    dictated the degeneration of the motherland.

From the starting point of a new nation looking for its identity, we set out to
devise an emblem which could convey the dignity of the new micro-nation, as
well as emphasize the hodge-podge, mish-mash nature of its modest and reckless
origins.

The resulting identity took the form of the country's mascot -- the lobster --
composed with graphic elements from the [Portuguese Coat of
Arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Portugal). The references to
Portuguese national iconography are echoed on other, less visible graphic
elements. For the logo itself, we resorted to an appropriately bastardised
typeface which had been originally designed in Germany, named after Holland and
released in Portugal; we took inspiration from the original, mid-century
letterforms to develop the "Nióbio" lettering (neatly avoiding the urge to use
the [Lobster font](http://www.impallari.com/lobster).
