Best Case Scenarios for Copyright was a campaign we designed for Communia,
presenting the best examples of copyright in different countries of the EU.

We went with our usual approach of solely working with source materials that
are free and open, For the campaign visuals, we worked with images in the
Public Domain and composed them into layouts meant to be printed at home. 

The typeface employed for the project's identity is the always-classy Reglo by
Love Letters.

All the materials produced are available [here](http://gitlab.com/manufacturaind/best-case-scenarios-copyright).
