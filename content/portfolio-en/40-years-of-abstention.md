[40 Years of Abstention](https://tmmv.github.io/abstencao) is a visualization
of the abstention in the Portuguese legislative election results, between 1975 and 2015.

It was developed in the context of the [TransparÃªncia Hackday Portugal](http://transparenciahackday.org) collective as an exploration of open data datasets.
After gathering and processing a comprehensive dataset of all the legislative election 
results in Portugal we wanted to find a visual way to show the evolution of abstention 
since the 75 revolution.
