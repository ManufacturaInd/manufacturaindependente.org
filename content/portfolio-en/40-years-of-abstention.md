[40 Years of Abstention](https://tmmv.github.io/abstencao) is an interactive visualization
of the abstention in the Portuguese legislative elections, between 1975 and 2015.

It was developed in the context of the [TransparÃªncia Hackday Portugal](http://transparenciahackday.org) collective as an exploration of what can be done using public open data, together with [Tiago Vieira](http://tiagovieira.pt).

After gathering and processing a comprehensive [dataset with all the results of the legislative elections in Portugal](http://centraldedados.pt/eleicoes-legislativas) we wanted to find a visual way to show the evolution of abstention 
since the 75 revolution. The vertical axis divides two ways to look at the results: on the left, the votes for each party as regularly presented; on the right, the votes in each party recalculated to include the abstention percentage.
