Manufactura Independente is a design studio based in Porto, Portugal. It was
founded in 2010 by **Ana Isabel Carvalho** and **Ricardo Lafuente** as a space
for both comissioned work and self-initiated projects.

Approach:
* work and involvement with free culture
* libre software workflows applied to design practice
* engagement with software -- not just tool operators
* exclusive use of F/LOSS
* creation and sharing of small, specialised and often experimental design tools
* community engagement (workshops, LGmag, open data)

Areas:
* Type design and technology. We love fonts and what makes them work.
* Editorial and graphic design. 
* Full-stack web development and design.
* Code-based design tactics.
The studio works in different areas, going from print to web design, engaging
in both community/cultural projects and commercial work.

### Services

* **Workshops.** We conceive, organise and facilitate experimental, results-driven workshops.

* **Full-stack web development.** We're at home with the nitty-gritty aspects
  of web development, and we're proficient in the front-end design side as
  well. We endeavour to take care of the full stack, ranging from visual
  concepts to server administration, back-end coding and user interface
  development. 

* **Design.** We are keen to work on most kinds of design tasks: branding,
  identity, print layouts and production, web presence

* **Consultancy.** Digital or print media, technical or conceptual, we are
  eager to take on problems and dilemmas in order to determine the best path
  forward, be it on your website, publication, company identity or mobile app. 

* **Custom tools and development**. Need a specialised, hand-tuned back-end? An
  extra feature on your WordPress-based site? A tool for automating your
  repetitive design or web-related tasks? That's our cup of tea.
