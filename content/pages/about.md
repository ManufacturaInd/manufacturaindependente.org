Manufactura Independente is a design studio based in Porto, Portugal. It was
founded in 2010 by **Ana Isabel Carvalho** and **Ricardo Lafuente** as a space
for both comissioned work and self-initiated projects.


### About our practice

Our approach floats around a set of key principles:

* **Involvement with free/libre culture.** It's not only about switching
  to different tools, but about welcoming a different mindset for design.
  Sharing our work, our tools and our processes is an integral part of what we
  do.
* **Libre workflows applied to design practice.** Not only do we employ an
  exclusively free/libre software stack, we enjoy tinkering, creating and
  sharing our own experimental design tools.
* **Engagement with software as a medium.** It's not just about operating tools
  with skill, it's about considering them as means to be questioned and
  improved upon. Only free and open tools give us that kind of agency.
* **Cross-media practice.** We love web, we love print, and we'll love whatever
  comes next.
* **Community engagement.** Be it through workshops, publications or work with
  public data, it's more fun to do it with others.


### Services

* **Workshops.** We conceive, organise and facilitate experimental,
  results-driven workshops. We're at ease to talk and work with several
  subjects: retro and contemporary font design, speculative data visualization,
  working with F/LOSS tools, layout and typeface experiments, and the list goes
  on. 

* **Full-stack web development.** We're at home with the nitty-gritty aspects
  of web development, and we're proficient in the front-end design side as
  well. We endeavour to take care of the full stack, ranging from visual
  concepts to server administration, back-end coding and user interface
  development. 

* **Design.** We are keen to work on most kinds of design tasks: branding,
  identity, print layouts and production, web presence, editorial projects,
  type design or design-oriented tools.

* **Consultancy.** Digital or print media, technical or conceptual, we are
  eager to take on problems and dilemmas in order to determine the best path
  forward, be it on your website, publication, company identity or mobile app. 

* **Custom tools and development**. Maybe you could use a specialised,
  hand-tuned back-end? An extra feature on your WordPress-based site? A tool
  for automating your repetitive design or web-related tasks? That's our cup of
  tea.
