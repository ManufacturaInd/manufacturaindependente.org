Manufactura Independente is a design studio based in Porto (Portugal), running fully on free and open source software.

It was founded in 2010 by [Ana Isabel Carvalho](https://twiiter.com/aiscarvalho) and [Ricardo Lafuente](https://twitter.com/rlaf) as a space for both comissioned work and autonomous/self-initiated projects.

The studio works in different areas, going from print to web design, engaging in both community/cultural projects and commercial work.
