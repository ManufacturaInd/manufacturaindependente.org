We started to work on the OFLB by redesigning its homepage. This would
allow us to set the mood for the website and define structural elements
such as the main navigation, font list, text and heading styles.

The first HTML mockup followed our paper sketches. Since we published it
we got feedback and that led us back to work on refining the page
structure and style.

For the font samples we adopted a more sober style: white background and
black text.  
This is the approach of most of the font websites we've seen. It is a
clear way to evidence the glyph shapes of each font but certainly not
the most exciting way to browse fonts.  
Having this in mind we're thinking how can we achieve a balance between
both straightforward font display and carefully designed type display.
After considering of all the details—from colour scheme, to page
structure and element hierarchy—we don't want to neglect the main thing:
the fonts.

In the screenshots it is also visible the composition changes we did
regarding the previous mockup:

<ul>
<li>
Featured fonts: this section is now a slideshow, displaying each font at
a time; and it is using the full content width.

</li>
<li>
The 'Text preview' box is now in the same column has the font list (a
suggestion by
[Dave](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/07/oflb-bringing-the-layout-to-life/)).

</li>
<li>
Main content area: we're still not sure if we're using an opaque
background colour or no background colour at all.

<li>
The footer has now more information even though it is part of the work
in progress.

</li>
<ul>
