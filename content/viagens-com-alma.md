We’ve been frequent collaborators of [Visões
Úteis](http://visoesuteis.pt "Visões Úteis"), a theatre company based in
Porto. [Viagens Com Alma](http://viagenscomalma.eu/ "Viagens com Alma")
was a long-duration project spanning several months and many artists
reflecting on religious imagery and subjective geography. We designed
some of the printed materials for Visões Úteis’ various steps through
this project.
