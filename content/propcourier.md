PropCourier is the canonical typeface for Libre Graphics magazine.
It was created through a conversion of OSP's [NotCourier Sans](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/notcouriersans) from a monospaced font into a proportional one. From there, we've been refining the design and releasing new versions with each issue of Libre Graphics magazine, until we settled on a final design when we released issue 2.2 of the magazine.
