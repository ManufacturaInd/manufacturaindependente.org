While making the first mockups for the OFLB site redesign, we
quickly whipped up a navigation header, including a tentative logo
proposal.

Not long after we published this, we got some wonderful feedback on the
[OFLB mailing
list](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openfontlibrary). We
were really happy to see that [Robert Martinez](http://mray.de/) joined
the discussion. Robert is a great designer who worked on various
FLOSS-related projects, and he’s responsible for the original OFLB logo.

In the process of making the first mockups, we decided that we wanted to
keep Robert’s original logo; however, we felt that it was also desirable
that the logo featured type with the project title.

In his
[critique](http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openfontlibrary/2011-July/003366.html),
Robert made some very relevant points:

> 1\. raising the brightness with an extra box under the logo reduces the
> contrast and makes the upper section too vivid without emphasising the
> logo itself.  
>  - why not make the font less bright and skip using the box?
>
> 2\. the two-colored logo scheme reflected in the type is too much:  
>  -it makes the "f" fall apart from the rest of the logo and defeats the
> reason for a clear monochrome logo: it adds to the extra vividness
> around the logo.  
>  -it puts an emphasis where none is needed, i think the connection to
> the open clipart library does not necessarily have to be reflected in
> the logo itself more than it already does.
>
> 3\. the aligned text on the left of the logo is a weakness.  
>  -the current layout starts with two right aligned lines, continues with
> centered and then stays left aligned.  
>  starting with the logo followed by left aligned text would put a
> natural emphasis on the logo.  
>  It even offeres to do something interesting with it there, like scaling
> it up a bit and putting some catchy visual elements around it that add
> to the general style.

We agree with all of the points that were raised, and are now back to
the drawing board so that we can come up with a good and lasting
solution for the OFLB logo.
