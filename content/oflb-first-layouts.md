We've been making a few (physical) sketches in order to find a good
layout for the website home page. From there, we'll be able to derive
the layout of other pages.

By doing pencil-on-paper mockups, we find that it's easier to get a
better view of the whole layout and figure out what should fit where,
without regards for more intricate styling choices; it does happen that
we get too involved in making little changes on the CSS file instead of
focusing on the whole thing and saving detail work for later. However,
it is definitely more flexible to begin working onscreen as soon as
possible â€” for instance, while doing the mockup above, we forgot to
include a text box for quick viewing custom text on the font previews.
Easier to begin doing the actual HTML version than spending time on
fixing the mockup with rubber and/or glue :-)

Now, on to think of the colour scheme for the site's identity!
