We have just started working on [Open Font
Library](http://openfontlibrary.org) with the task of rethinking the
site's look and structure, as well as other improvements that we'll
share later. Taking up a challenge put forward by Dave Crossland, we'll
also try and blog our work process.

As a result of our first impressions of the current website and other
existing type websites, we came up with a few ideas to work on.

One of the things that we noted down was the big difference between
printed type catalogues and online catalogues. The first taste of type
for the web is still not much explored at the blooming field of
typography web services.

So that's how we came to the formulation of our first idea for the Open
Font Library font list: How can you show the available fonts and
possible use cases — the kind of font presentation you always find in
printed specimens?

In order to try it out this approach, we came up with this:
<http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/font-list>

We get the current font list layout — simple and clean — but with an
added font use example on mouse hover. Our idea would be to create a set
of examples, each of them composed by background color, background
image, text color and text shadow; then, apply them randomly on the font
list. This way, there's no immediate need for human input —
auto-specimens!

Before getting to this result, we experimented the same thing but with
an alternate text on hover (as you can see in the image that illustrates
the post). As we went on styling the text, we understood that this would
be a much harder feature to implement and maintain. If we ought to go
this way, we would probably need to have an editor who would manually
fine-tune the samples.  
Even though what we came up with is much simpler, it is already a good
hint for users of a typeface's capabilities.
