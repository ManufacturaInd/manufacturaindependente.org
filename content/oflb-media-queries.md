The current OFLB website has alternative layouts according to
the browser window width. Taking advantage of css media queries the
layout is re-shaped to better fit screens in different devices.

Having set the general layout for the new version of OFLB, we moved into
adapting it with media queries.  
We started with the homepage and are still fine tunning the layout foe
the Catalogue pages.

The biggest challenge we had so far was rethinking the main menu for
small widths.  
To be able to organize it efficiently we divided it in three rows:

\* the first has the search, language and sign in menu;  
\* the second has the logo â€” centered horizontally and bigger top and
bottom margins;  
\* the third has the catalogue and documentation.
