We've been busy taking care of loose ends and finishing touches on the
last details of our mockups, having just finished the font family page.
Now that it was greenlit, we're working with Fabricatorz to integrate
our designs into the actual site. We're learning how Aiki works and
figuring out how we can make our tweaks. The Aiki framework has very
interesting concepts for web development, and we've been collecting a
few wishlist items and ideas for making it even more awesome.

Parallel to that, we're also editing and re-writing parts of the OFLB
Guidebook in order to make it a solid reference for everything related
to open fonts. Next week we'll be putting that part of our work online,
so that it can also be checked and improved by anyone.
