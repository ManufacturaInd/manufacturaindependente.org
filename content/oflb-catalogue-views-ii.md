Following our [layout
ideas](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/07/oflb-catalogue-views/)
for the catalogue page we moved to building the [HTML
mockup](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110727-catalogue/catalogue-sentence.html).  
We kept the main idea—being able to browse the font list in three view
modes: word, sentence and paragraph—but refined some interface aspects.

Dave pointed out that the More Options slider might be confusing, and
that all options should be visible, so we discarded that part of the
design. We moved the filters—by Categorie and Licence—to the right
sidebar; and placed the sorting options—Order by Most recent / Older /
Name / Popularity—just above the font list.  
The distinction between filters and sorting made it easy to decide
whether something should be placed in the central column or the right
sidebar.

When finishing the paragraph view we opted to change the layout. Instead
of one column we opted for two columns of fonts. This proved to be a
more comfortable way for viewing and reading paragraphs. One column was
larger than needed.

The main menu has also evolved:

-   the logo lost its beige box;
-   it was added a style for the active menu section -- in this example,
    Catalogue;
-   and the ‘Sign in’ got moved to the right, since it is not a section
    of the website.
