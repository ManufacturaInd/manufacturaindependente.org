As we pin down the last details of the new design for OFLB, we're also
busy redoing the OFLB Guidebook.

Our assignment here is to review and complement the existing information
on the Guidebook. This implies going through existing wiki pages, gather
the relevant bits and place them under a new, more consistent structure
that is closer to an actual guidebook.

So now, we're giving the finishing touches to a first version of the
glossary (inspired by the approach taken by Ginger on Libre Graphics
Magazine), where we're placing little snippets of information about more
or less obscure parts of type terminology.

We are still working on a local installation of MediaWiki, and our next
task will be to place it online as we work on it.
