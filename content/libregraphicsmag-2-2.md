We're very pleased to announce the release of issue 2.2 of Libre
Graphics magazine. This issue, built around the theme "Gendering
F/LOSS," engages with discussions around representation and gendered
work in Free/Libre Open Source Software and Free Culture.

We invite you to buy the print edition of the issue or [download the
PDF](http://libregraphicsmag.com/ "Issues"). We invite both potential
readers and submittors to download, view, write, pull, branch and
otherwise engage.

Why Gendering F/LOSS?
---------------------

In the world of F/LOSS, and in the larger world of technology, debate
rages over the under-representation of women and the frat house attitude
occasionally adopted by developers. The conventional family lives of
female tech executives are held up as positive examples of progress in
the battle for gender equity.

Conversely, pop-cultural representations of male developers are
evolving, from socially awkward, pocket-protectored nerds to
cosmopolitan geek chic. Both images mask the diversity of styles and
gender presentations found in the world of F/LOSS and the larger tech
ecology.

Those images also mask important discussions about bigger issues: is it
okay to construct such a strict dichotomy between "man" and "woman" as
concepts; how much is our work still divided along traditional gender
lines; is it actually enough to get more women involved in F/LOSS
generally, or do we need to push for specific kinds of involvement; do
we stop at women, or do we push for a more inclusive understanding of
representation?

This issue looks at some of the thornier aspects of gender in F/LOSS art
and design. In discussing gendered work, the push for greater and
greater inclusion in our communities, and representations of gender in
our artistic practices, among others, we hope to add and amplify voices
in the discussion.

Gendering F/LOSS is the second issue in volume two of Libre Graphics
magazine (ISSN 1925-1416). Libre Graphics magazine is a print
publication devoted to showcasing and promoting work created with
Free/Libre Open Source Software. We accept work about or including
artistic practices which integrate Free, Libre and Open software,
standards, culture, methods and licenses.
