The next release of the OFLB website will allow multi-language
support. To help on the task of translation the platform each user will
be able to access the translation files and make a contribution.

Since this will be a completely new page we came up with a first mockup
for its interface. It can be seen
[here](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110725-translation/).

We decided to go for a single column page. This has the advantage of:

-   focusing the user’s attention on the task being performed—in this
    case, the translation.
-   allowing a table with comfortable column width for reading and
    writing.

Most of the translation interfaces we researched were two table columns:
one column for the original string of text and another for the
translation. Some of them had a third column with the context of the
translated string. We found this most useful and decided to include it
in the interface.  
The translation table is always in ‘editable mode’: just click the
translation ‘cell’, write and hit the save button (or the Enter
key).
