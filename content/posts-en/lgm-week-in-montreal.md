From the 6th to the 15th of May we were at Montréal for the
[Libre Graphics Meeting
2011](http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2011/).  
These were intense days and we ended up not managing to post while
still there.  
As a result we got home with a big list of stuff we had done in our
heads and just decided to write it down quickly to share.

Here is the list of some of the things we did while at Montréal:

-   Discovered a very simple and powerful stop motion animation software
    called [Toonloop](http://toonloop.com/). The main developer, Alessandre
    Cressy, hosted a pre-LGM workshop and an LGM talk on this wonderful
    tool.

-   Rented Bixis (Montréal rental bikes): best way to get to know the city.
    Had a nightmarish experience to find a parking spot after 00am.

-   Debated on the theme of [Tools](http://libregraphicsmag.com/tools/) with
    Eric Schrijver, Peter Linell at StudioXX. This was also the motto for a
    poster exhibition curated by ginger coons for the LGM week.

-   Learned to sew with [Susan Spencer](http://www.sew-brilliant.org/). And
    started an automated tool to generate patterns using a graphical user
    interface.

-   Assisted a full afternoon of drawing [Famous
    People](http://www.openclipart.org/packages-famous-people) for the Open
    Clip Art Library.

-   Got blown out once again by Tom Lechner's presentation on
    [Laidout](http://www.laidout.org/).

-   Actively participated in
    [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus) and
    [Inskcape](http://inkscape.org/) BOF's. Exciting times ahead.

-   Presented one year of Libre Graphics Magazine; offered copies of issue
    1.1; sold copies of issue 1.2 and released PropCourier on Open Font
    Library.

-   Got interviewed for the Creative Commons blog about the Libre Graphics
    Magazine. The set was the living room of our rented apartment: me,
    ginger and Ricardo seated in a luxurious white leather couch.
    *Update: watch the interview [here](http://labs.creativecommons.org/2011/07/05/libre-graphics-magazine-interview-at-libre-graphics-meeting/).*

-   Met Matt Lee, from the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/);
    Christopher Allan Webber, from Blender and Creative Commons, who gave
    the awesomest talk about Python scripting in Blender!

-   Ate delicious minestrone cooked by Femke; portobello burgers cooked by
    John Haltiwanger; vegetarian pataniscas with naughty tomato rice and
    spinach by me and Ricardo; and delicious vegan pie with mushrooms and
    soy gravy cooked by ginger.

-   Broke a coffe machine, a toaster and the back door to our apartment (all
    fixed in time).

-   Fixed the back door with the wise help of [Martin
    Owens](http://doctormo.org/).

-   Had the chance to meet Michael Mulley, the person behind the
    [openparliament.ca](http://openparliament.ca/) website.

-   Presented [Shoebot](http://shoebot.net/) at the Montréal Python User
    Group meeting.

-   Biked, bused, metroed and walked all over the city of Montréal.

-   Visited John Lovell's printing house.

-   Planned a year ahead of Libre Graphics Magazine.

-   Stole a selection of five hilarious city postcards from ginger to mail
    home before leaving to Porto.

-   Bought maple syrup planning for a delicious pancake afternoon with
    friends in Porto.

-   Got some serious advice about work and business attitude from Pierre
    Marchand.

-   Tried out Pierre Marchand's [Fonzie](http://www.oep-h.com/fonzie/). A
    program to generate typefaces from drawings. It works!

-   Rode a school bus with a bunch of LGM geeks.

-   Attended the book launch [*Paying for
    it*](http://www.drawnandquarterly.com/shopCatalogLong.php?st=art&art=a3dff7dd51fc01),
    by Chester Brown at Drawn & Quarterly's bookshop.

-   Got a private [Krita](%20http://www.krita.org) introduction by Boudewijn
    and AnimTim. Looking forward to do beautiful work with it.

-   Ate bland cantine food at the Polytechnique and experienced two
    extraordinary gourmet dinners by chef Beaver.

-   Stumbled upon the braveness of the
    [OSP](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/) with their [Sans Guilt
    font](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/sans-guilt/). Serious
    design thinking and acting, lead by Femke Snelting, Ludivine Loiseau,
    Pierre Marchand and John Haltiwanger.

-   Saw ginger present the eulogy of Open Colour Standard.

-   Managed to carry home 40 copies of issue 1.2 of [Libre Graphics
    magazine](http://libregraphicsmag.com/). Dear subscribers, we'll send
    you your copies this week!

-   Finally understood the reason to Aloe Blacc's song *I need a dollar*
    when getting on 747, the shuttle bus to Montreal airport.

-   Got home full of energy. It indeed was a great week.

-   We shared some photos of this week
