We have just finished a [revised
version](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110805-homepage/) of
the OFLB homepage.  
Some changes might be almost invisible but they’re getting us closer to
the final thing.

[![OFLB Homepage]({static}/media/homepage-e1312560839651.png "homepage")](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110805-homepage/)

Starting from top to bottom we’ll go through the changes since the [last
published
mockup](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/07/oflb-fleshing-out-the-home-page/).

**1. Main menu**  
The Open Font Library type is now in one single color, matching the
logo.  
The right menu was re-ordered having in mind its usability. The search
box is now the leftmost item, followed by the language menu and the sign
in link at the right.

**2. Featured fonts slideshow**  
We took out the white background that encircled the Featured Fonts
section.  
The slideshow navigation was moved up and the slides now have a large
white border.  
The featured fonts are now also affected by the text preview input
(more fun!)

**3. Latest Fonts**  
Fixed a JQuery bug from the text preview box on page reload.  
Updated the button at the bottom of the list. It is now much wider and
read “Browse the complete Catalogue”.

**4. Right sidebar**  
Renamed some of the section titles and re-organized the Statistics
section.  
The Statistics will now link to a page of its own. Since most right
sidebar titles are not linked to any page we had to come up with a
styled for titles that are also links. Since there is a link to the
Statistics page — the “See full statistics” button — we settled for a
simple arrow icon at the right of the title.

**5. Footer**  
Added a paragraph thanking all the project patrons and a link to the
donation page.
