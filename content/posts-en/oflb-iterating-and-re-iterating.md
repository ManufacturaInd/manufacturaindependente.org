We decided that we had to settle on a definitive design for
every element in the home page, so that we end up with a fixed
repertoire of graphic elements to apply on the other pages. This means
we have to decide on the website logo quickly — it’s the kind of
creative decision that can drag itself for weeks if we let perfectionism
take over. So we want to close that decision today.

Our main issue is that it isn’t exactly trivial to fit the existing OFLB
logo with typography. It’s also a consequence of our being too spoiled
for choice: if we had a limited set of lead typefaces, or just enough
paper for 5 mock-ups, our process would be much more constrained. But in
2011, [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) provides us with millions of
colours, a considerable set of fonts (that we keep adding to thanks to
[OFLB](http://www.openfontlibrary.org) and [Google Web
Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)) and no worries about wasting
paper or ink with our digital mockups. And so, feeling a bit lost among
all of the possibilities, we keep iterating in order to hopefully come
up with a logo that we’re happy with.

And if we’re not totally happy, tough luck — we definitely need to
close this file ASAP, since so many months could be spent in search for
the perfect logo, and there’s a lot more work to be done before the end
of the month.
