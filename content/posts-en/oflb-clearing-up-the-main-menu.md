[![Main menu]({filename}/media/main-menu00.png "main-menu00")]({filename}/media/main-menu00.png)

Last friday we did some sketches for the OFLB main menu. We started
laying it out based on our
[blueprint](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openfontlibrary/+spec/header-menu).
Since we're not working only redesign but also on reorganizing
information we tried to figure how to compose all the new items and how
to create distinctions between them.

We're divided between two possibilities: a more complete and descritive
menu, as the one in the image; or a more compact one, with only one
level of links.  
Besides that we're considering:

-   flexibility — how will the menu accommodate new sections that need
    to be added later.
-   usability — we want to have the search box always ready to use and
    find a way to incorporate the login form.
-   hierarchy — we want to make the menu as clear as possible.

A composition as the one in the sketch makes it clearer the website's
organization for users. On the other hand it poses somes questions on
this strutucture's flexibility.  
The other importante focus is the OFLB logo. This is one of our first
experiences to integrate text in the existing logo to make it a stronger
element of the menu, distinctive from the others.

We keep working on the menu so more experiences will be coming out this
week.
