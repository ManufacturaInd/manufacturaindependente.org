The footer has been subject to several changes as the redesign and
layout for the OFLB website evolved.

We seem to have finally settled and reached a balanced composition. We
kept all the elements in the current website — copyright notice, menu
and credits — and added the project patrons as
[Dave](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/07/oflb-catalogue-views-ii/#comments)
suggested.

We tried to make the hierarchy of elements as clear as possible:

-   at the top, the Open Font Library logotype and copyright notice;
-   followed by the menu — we mashed together the website’s main menu
    and the auxiliary menu (terms of service, bug reports, feature
    request);
-   the patron’s list;
-   and, at the bottom, the website credits.

We strive for clean and semantically correct code. As a result of that
we decide to compose monochrome versions of the patron's logos in a
single sprite. The sprite was positioned with css and used as background
image.
