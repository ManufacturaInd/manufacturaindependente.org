The premise was to design a typeface based in the lettering on the facade of an historical building, known as the Belgian Sawmill, that would be the future home of [Medialab-Prado](http://medialab-prado.es/).

In a three day sprint we guided the 23 participants – ranging from designers to font enthusiasts – from rough paper sketches to smooth digital drawings of the all the letters, numbers and punctuation.

Serreria Extravagante and Serreria Sobria were the two fonts resulting from this collective effort. They were released under the Open Font License and are now used in the signage and graphic identity of Medialab-Prado.
