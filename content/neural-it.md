Neural Magazine is the highest reference on media art for more
than 20 years now. We were commissioned to design and implement a new
website for its digital sister site [Neural.it](http://neural.it).

The effort involved much more than a re-design: we wrote extensive
scripts in order to convert more than 10 years of articles from Movable
Type to WordPress. This task involved merging English and Italian posts,
fixing and updating old HTML tags, generating custom RSS feeds and
adapting the internal taxonomy to the WordPress structure — all done
automatically using our carefully crafted custom Python parsers.

The theme we built from scratch makes heavy use of custom WordPress post
types and taxonomies. This way, the Neural editors are able to organise
and manage posts, microposts, display ads, issue releases and other
content through the WordPress interface with little hassle.

We also executed a lighter version for Neural's music blog, [Wicked
Style](http://wickedstyle.neural.it/).  
Finally, we created a JavaScript snippet that allows the user to strip
the site from any colour, making it all black and white. It's a tiny
detail, but we do love the monochrome visuals as they complete an
overall design that heavily refers to the printed page without looking
old-school.
