After publishing the [initial
sketch](http://blog.manufacturaindependente.org/2011/08/oflb-the-font-page/)
for the font page we decided to re-think its structure.

One the problems we first came across was the large amount of
information that was necessary to display for font families with
variants. In order to tackle this, we proposed an alternative layout
where each variant would be a sub-section in the font page. For each
font variant there would be a tab based navigation organized into
sections: font overview (samples and specimen), information and embed
code.

After discussing the idea with Dave it was clear that this was not the
way to go, since there aren't many secondary elements to justify
breaking down the page â€” everything's important and needs to be
immediately visible in the font family page.

The second major issue this layout introduced was layered navigation.
Dividing the information of each font variant into sections and tabs
meant we would be able to have shorter pages. However, it forces the
users to go through more clicks and browse through more pages to see a
full font family.

With this in mind, we went back to the initial sketch, settling for a
single page displaying all the necessary information, with navigation
helpers at the top.

We maintained the two column layout: the left column for font samples
and the right sidebar for font information.

So in the left column we have:

-   Text preview input and color controls.
-   Re-styled the waterfall: smaller font sizes (starting from 36px
    instead of 56!) and a single line per size.
-   Added a character map and a paragraph sample.

And in the right column:

-   The download button was prominently placed at the top, followed by
    the updated date and font license.
-   Two new sections were introduced: *Use this font* and *Language
    Support*. The first one is intended to provide users with the embed
    code to use the font in a webpage (not yet complete in this mockup).
    The second shows the font language support and prods users to
    contribute.
