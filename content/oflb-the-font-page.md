This is the
[mockup](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110802-fontpage/) of
the font page. For this, we used Maven Pro, a font with 4 styles --
Regular, Medium, Bold and Black. We chose to use a font with a few
styles to see how could we fit a considerable amount of information in
the page, as opposed to a font with a single style.

In the layout, we maintained a two column design: the left column
displays the font previews and the right sidebar features the font
information.

We’re fond of the current Open Font Library text preview input, at the
top of the page. It is a unique approach to text preview inputs and it
gives the OFLB website an identity of its own. Therefore, we decided to
keep it.

We added a font waterfall for each style and re-styled the details for
each font variant. Instead of being shown in text, they are represented
by an icon; currently we’ve only drawn the icons for the font format
(OpenType and TrueType) so please don’t mind the little brown squares.
The full information text is displayed on a tooltip when hovering over
the icons.
