At some point around 2012, we found ourselves with a small set of scripts developed to work with fonts.

We’re fans of FontForge and its Python scripting interface – we like the idea of an ImageMagick-like tool for fonts. We’ve released the scripts we hacked together, covering easy conversion between type formats, quick effects for batch font generation, and a few other handy shortcuts like Transpacing, a tool for transplanting font spacing between typefaces.
