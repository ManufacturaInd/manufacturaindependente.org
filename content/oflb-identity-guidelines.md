We've completed a first concise version of the identity guidelines
(regard this as alpha!). We took cues from the [Novacut
guidelines](http://blog.novacut.com/2011/05/new-novacut-brand-and-identity.html),
but left out most of the text describing the base function of a brand
and logo, at least for the moment.

Download the [PDF
version](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/identity.pdf) or [SVG
version](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/identity.svg). In case
you want to open the SVG version, be sure to have the following fonts
installed: Maven Pro, Muli, PT Sans, PT Serif.

Taking into account that this document is aimed at designers who will
work with/on the OFLB identity, we avoided the usual "Do not do this or
that" kind of copy, instead trying to provide tips on how to get around
the restrictions in the guidelines.

We want to make an HTML5 version of these guidelines as well, but we
have higher priorities in our TODO, namely updating the HTML templates
in order to incorporate the new design. <!--:-->
