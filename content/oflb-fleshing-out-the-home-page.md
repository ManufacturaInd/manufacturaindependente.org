<!--:en-->Going on with the work on the home page, here's some of the
changes that we've been busy on. You can see the [current
version](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110721-homepage/) of
the home page design, even though there's still quite a bit of work
left.

**Logo**  
We settled on a logo proposal, and while we were at it, we tried to
have the logo typography as HTML text, so that logo and menu can be
better integrated.

**Featured Fonts**  
Gave more focus to the Featured Fonts, separated their look from the
Latest Fonts section, refined the slide show and included some
HTML5-friendly font previews using only CSS and background images.

**Preview Boxes**: Tried different shadowing styles on the font preview
boxes, as well as different layouts for the information bars underneath.

**General layout**  
More generous margins, narrower sidebar and bigger text leading make
the website lighter; we also cut down on some stylistic effects, such as
the font preview input box, which is now simpler and closer to the
current OFLB design; more consistent footer section.<!--:-->
