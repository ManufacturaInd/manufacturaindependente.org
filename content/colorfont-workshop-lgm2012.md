During the recent Libre Graphics Meeting in Vienna, we hosted a
typography workshop, under the theme of multicoloured fonts. While
developing version 1.1 of
[Colorfont.js](http://manufacturaindependente.org/colorfont), we put
together a collection of colorfonts -- variations of one font that can
be used with different colours, overlaying each other.

This had us thinking about the specifics designing a font to be used
with two or more colours, particularly how to "cut" a font, meaning the
division of a typeface into two or more colour areas. Looking at past
instances of coloured type, we began wondering which kind of cuts could
be made to the glyphs, which cuts work best, how to achieve rhythm, and
how to systematize the cuttings, finding if possible some kind of logic
in the process.

Having all this in mind, we did a first experimental session around
colorfonts in Brussels, during our residency at [Constant
Variable](http://variable.constantvzw.org/). From that workshop,
everyone came up with many ideas and input for new colorfont designs,
during a full afternoon around letters and colour. We took some cues
from this session to organize the Colorfont Workshop in Vienna.

We had only two hours available and a mix audience of artists &
programmers. We started with a quick intro to the theme and moved to
dribbling with pen and paper right away. For this session we choose a
set of five libre fonts: [Changa
One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Changa+One), [League
Gothic](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic), [M+ P
Black](http://mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/design/index-en.html#prop),
[Monserrat](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Montserrat) and
[Paytone One](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Paytone+One). We
printed out the uppercase latin alphabet using outlined letters and
distributed them among the participants.

We wanted each person to plan in paper what they would execute later in
FontForge -- it's too easy to lose oneself in the program, so the goal
was to have everything fleshed out before even touching the computer.
After that we moved to a quick Fontforge tutorial, focusing on
techniques for subtracting parts of a glyph.

While some went forward translating their paper designs into actual
colorfonts, other participants struggled with getting Fontforge to work,
specifically inside OSX. Lesson learned for future workshops: the only
safe way to have Fontforge running on OSX is to use a virtual machine
running a GNU/Linux system; in the next workshops we'll bring some
ready-made virtual machine installations so that anyone can quickly run
an instance of Fontforge without hassle.

The workshop ended with some bright surprises: not only having finished
a full uppercase colorfont, Simon Budig found the time and determination
to fix a selection bug in Colorfont.js.

Other participants also came up with some clever and beautiful designs,
which are now showcased at the Colorfont website.[Check them
