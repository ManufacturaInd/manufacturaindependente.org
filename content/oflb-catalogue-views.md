<!--:en-->While we fine-tune design details in the home page, we’ve been
concocting some preliminary mockups for the catalogue pages. The
catalogue is the part of OFLB where you can browse the whole collection
of fonts. There are two main concerns for the catalogue design: you need
to be able to get a wide look into the variety of typefaces available,
and at the same time you need a good way to spot details and see how the
font actually looks like. We’ve started trying this out doing Inkscape
mock pages.

So in this case, we followed the structure used by Google Web Fonts,
which gives the user choice in how to display the fonts. You can opt for
a compact view of single words, a wide view of a single sentence, or a
larger view of a full body paragraph. Not only does this allow you to
see how the fonts perform in specific contexts, it also gives you the
choice to see more fonts at once (word view) or see individual fonts in
more detail (paragraph view).
