[Colorfont.js](http://manufacturaindependente.com/colorfont) gave us a perfect excuse to dive into the world of coloured typography. While designing overlays of existing libre fonts to distribute along with this jQuery script we saw the possibilities of type design out of the comon monochromatic approaches.
With an informal introduction to coloured typography we get participants in the right mindset. Then we get them to use FontForge to cut and mangle typefaces in order to create beautiful new things.
We developed this workshop during our [residency at Constant Variable](http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/blog/news/colored-beehive), in February of 2012. We organised two sessions so far: one in the LGM 2012 in Vienna and another in the University of Coimbra, in 2013.
