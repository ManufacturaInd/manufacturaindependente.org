After sketching up the layout for the new homepage we moved to coding.  
We wanted to see if it would work on screen or if we would need to
rethink the composition of elements.

The mockup we came up with can be seen
[here](http://manufacturaindependente.com/oflb/20110712-homepage/).
Don't mind the OFLB logo in the header menu. It is just a placeholder
for now. As far as browser compatibility is concerned we only checked it
in Firefox and Chrome.

We created a repository to keep our HTML mockups.  
Today we'll be getting more into this:  
the header menu needs more work as well as the footer, there is still
information to be added to the page and a lot of other details.  
Still we're happy with the little jQuery touch in the 'Font Tester'
feature.
